# learning-log
Learning Log is a web app that allows users to save topics they're interested in and to make journal entries as they learn more about it. This is an exercise-project from the book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes with No Starch Press Inc. I do not intend to pass it off as my own idea, however it is my own work.
## goal
I am engaging in this exercise to get a hands-on look at the Django framework, and learn the basics of database, APIs, and standard query practice. By publishing my work here, I hope to improve at using Git for version control and project managment. 
## Functions
### log-in
Users will be able to create their own account to log data as they please. 
### Topics & Entries
In learning log, users will create <b>topics</b> that they are interested in learning about. As the user endeavors to discover more about their topic they will be free to create an <b>entries</b>. These entries log the progress and knowledge that the user has gained since commiting to a given topic. Entries complete with dates to show when a user has posted a given entry. 

### Future Features
One feature I'm excited to roll out is a log frequency chart to let a user visualize how frequenly or infrequently they have been learning/logging.
